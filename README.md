<b>This project is built</b> on <br>
   * Java<br>
	 * Cucumber<br>
	 * TestNG<br>
	 * Maven<br>
	 
<b>Reporting</b><br>
*Extent reporting is used for automation execution report.<br>

<b>As part of Manual test I have found few observations as below</b> -<br>

1.Cap rate % sign popping down when there is 4 digit value. e.g if its 10.12 then % sign is not aligned.<br>
2.If there is no NOI provided& if Average Unit size is provided then Export CSV & Cap rate fields are not populating.This maybe expected based on functionality.<br>
  I will prefer to discuss with Product owner to see what is expected here.<br>
3.I have intentionally failed test SearchFeature04 to demonstrate failed scenario in the execution extent report.<br>
