Extent reporting is used for automation execution report.

As part of Manual test i have found few observations as below -
1.Cap rate % sign popping down when there is 4 digit value. e.g if its 10.12 then % sign is not aligned.
2.If there is no NOI provided& if Average Unit size is provided then Export CSV & Cap rate fields are not populating.This maybe expected based on functionality.
I will prefer to discuss with Product owner to see what is expected here.
3.I have intentionally failed test SearchFeature04 to demonstrate failed scenario in the execution extent report.
